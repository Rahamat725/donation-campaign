# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh


Three features that I have added in this project

- Search functionality
If you search with category name, you will see all the cards which categories are same.

- Created Donation page 
If you click on the card it will redirect to details page, and then  if you click donate button it will save localStorage and will show donation page.

- Created Nav Bar
There are three menus if you click any one of them it will redirect to that particular page.
